# Strava Activity Mapper
This app allows to view one's [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) activities in one overview in this dashboard. The idea started while discussing [Statshunters](https://statshunters.com/) and the potential to make other views. It builds on the Python third party libraries [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [polyline](https://pypi.org/project/polyline/).

## Installation
Not required as the app is hosted on [https://share.streamlit.io/](https://share.streamlit.io/)
